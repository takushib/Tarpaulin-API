Final project for CS493 (Cloud-based application development). Tarpaulin is a simple LMS (similar to canvas) that allows users (instructors and students) to see information about the courses theyâ€™re teaching/taking.  It allows instructors to create assignments for their courses, and it allows students to submit solutions for those assignments.
