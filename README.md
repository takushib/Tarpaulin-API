# Tarpaulin-API
Final project for CS493 (Cloud-based application development). Tarpaulin is a simple LMS (similar to Canvas) that allows users (instructors and students) to see information about the courses theyâ€™re teaching/taking.  It allows instructors to create assignments for their courses, and it allows students to submit solutions for those assignments. This is strictly the API for Tarpaulin, no frontend was required. Tests can be run in Postman.
